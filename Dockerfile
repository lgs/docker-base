# Dockerfile for Base Image Creation 
# Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander)
# Built with Debianâ€™s tool Debootstrap
# See DOCKER index lgsd/saucy

# VERSION    1.1

# Apply Dockerfile Best Practices :
#
# 1. Keep common instructions at the top of the
#    Dockerfile to utilize the cache.
#
# 2. Always pass -t to tag the resulting image.
#
# 3. Never map the public port in a Dockerfile.
#
# 4. Always use the array syntax when using CMD
#    and ENTRYPOINT.
#
# 5. ENTRYPOINT and CMD are better together.
